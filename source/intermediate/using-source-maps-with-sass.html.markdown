# Using source maps with Sass 3.3

Even though some of us have been kicking the tires with pre-release versions of Sass 3.3 for some time, now that [it's officially released](http://thesassway.com//news/sass-3-3-released) we can really start diving in to the new features it offers us. One new feature that every Sass developer should take advantage of is source maps.

Source maps are a way to associate compiled code with source code. In practice, this means that when you inspect an element with developer tools, rather than seeing the CSS styles associated with that element, you see the code we *really* care about: the pre-compiled Sass.

## Generating source maps

Creating a source map file is as easy as adding a flag to sass's command line tool:

    :::bash
    $ sass sass/screen.scss:stylesheets/screen.css --sourcemap

If you look in your output folder after running that command, you'll notice two things. First, a comment has been generated at the end of the CSS file:

    :::css
    /*# sourceMappingURL=screen.css.map */

This points to an additional file that was created during compilation: `screen.css.map`, which - as the name implies - is what maps all of the compiled CSS back to the source Sass declarations. If you're interested in the details of this file and how source maps actually work, check out Ryan Seddon's [*Introduction to JavaScript Source Maps*](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) over at HTML5Rocks. (Even though the article implies that it's only about JavaScript, all source maps work the same.)

## Enabling source maps in the browser

Okay, we have a source map file, but now we need to tell our browsers to look for it. Chrome, Firefox and Safari all have support for source maps.

### Chrome

If you're using Chrome, source maps are now part of the core feature set, so you don't have to monkey around in `chrome://flags`. Simply open up the DevTools settings and toggle the `Enable CSS Source Maps` option:

### Firefox

For Firefox users, source maps are available in [Aurora](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/), the pre-Beta build of Firefox. To enable source maps, right-click anywhere on the inspectorâ€™s rule view or in the Style Editor to get a context menu, then select the `Show original sources` option. (More info is available at the [Mozilla blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/live-editing-sass-and-less-in-the-firefox-developer-tools/).)

### Safari

Safari is a bit ahead of the curve in terms of source map support. If a map file is detected, references are automatically changed to the source-mapped files, no configuration necessary.

Once source maps are enabled in your browser of choice, the source reference for every style will change from the generated CSS to the source Sass, right down to the line number. Amazing!

## Another tool in our belt

Just as Firebug and its successors drastically improved our ability to debug problems, source maps increase the depth of our diagnostic capabilities. By allowing us to directly access our pre-compiled code, we can find and fix problems faster than ever. Now that I've been using source maps for a few months, I can't imagine working without them.

# The Sass Way

This is the main repository for The Sass Way! Your source for the latest tips,
tricks, and news about Sass and Compass.

Interested in submitting an article or news item? We welcome contributions! To
get started read our [contributing guidelines][1].

## Getting started

TheSassWay is powered by [Middleman][2]. Middleman is a Ruby-powered static
site generator that allows us to store the source for the entire website here
in GitHub.

To run the site on your local machine, you'll need to have [Ruby][3] setup with
[Bundler][4]. New to the command prompt? [Start here.][5]

First, install the necessary Gems:

    bundle install

Then start the preview server:

    rake server

This will startup a Middleman preview server on:

    http://localhost:5000

That's really it! Edit files in the source directory and refresh your browser
to see your changes.
